# vifros CLI

## To enable commands suggestion and auto-completion, execute:

```
vifros --install >> /home/ubuntu/.bashrc
source /home/ubuntu/.node-completion/vifros
```

**TODO:** Automatize this task when the package gets installed.
When executing the first command, it still not output the .node-completion folder.
Its needed to execute first `vifros`. Check with `completion` author about a fix.

## TODO

* Provide auto-completion on two level routes like `tables/routes`.
